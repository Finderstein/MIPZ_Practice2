# MIPZ Practice 2

Before start you need to clone some library to analyze inside ```libraries``` directory.

For example you can clone angular repo from here ```git clone https://github.com/angular/angular.git```

After that you can simply do the following:

```
npm i
npm start <full path to the index.ts of package>
```
After cloning angular repo <full path to the index.ts of package> can be something like D:\Practice2\libraries\angular\packages\compiler-cli\index.ts
  
As you can see, we analyze not angular as a whole, but only angular compiler-cli.
